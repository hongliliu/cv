\section*{Areas of Research: }
\begin{itemize}
    \item The astrophysics of massive star formation, with a focus on
        observations of proto-cluster clumps and massive outflows
    \item The physical properties of the molecular interstellar medium,
        supersonic turbulence, and formaldehyde and other molecules as probes
        of local physical conditions. 
    \item Observing with single-dish heterodyne and continuum millimeter
        instruments, single dish and synthesis array radio imaging,  and
        optical and near infrared imaging and spectroscopy. 
    \item The development of software tools for the analysis and visualization
        of diffuse and extended emission, spectral data cubes, and large
        astronomical data sets.
